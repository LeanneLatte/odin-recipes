            <h1>Potato Dauphinois</h1>
            <img src="img/potato.jpg" alt="Dish of potato dauphinois on a table">
            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Thin slices of potato slow cooked in the oven with cream and garlic - the most decadent of potato side dishes. Also enjoyable as a complete dish on it's own!</p>

            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>8 large King Edward or Maris Piper potatoes</li>
                <li>3 garlic cloves</li>
                <li>500ml vegan double cream</li>
                <li>500ml vegan milk</li>
                <li>100g grated vegan cheese (optional)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat oven to 190C / 170C Fan / Gas Mark 5.</li>
                <li>Add milk, cream and garlic to a large saucepan and simmer gently.</li>
                <li>Finely slice 8 large potatoes, add them to the cream and simmer for 3-5 minutes until just cooked, gently stirring throughout to prevent the potato from sticking to the bottom of the pan.</li>
                <li>Remove the potatoes with a slotted spoon and layer them evenly in a wide shallow overnproof dish.</li>
                <li>Pour over the garlic infused cream - just enough to seep through the layers and leave a little moisture on the surface.</li>
                <li><em>Optional</em> - sprinkle over the grated cheese.</li>
                <li>Bake for 30 minutes until the potatoes are soft and golden brown on top.</li>
                <li>Serve with salt and pepper to taste - enjoy on it's own or as a side dish.</li>
            </ol>
